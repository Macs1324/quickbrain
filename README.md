# QuickBrain

## What is QuickBrain?
Quickbrain is a library for Deep Learning in the making.

Quickbrain is currently at an extremely early stage of development

## What is supported?
Not a lot, as of not it is only CPU-based Dense neural networks. However, there already is some infrastructure to start setting up new types of models and layers.


## What will be supported?
I hope to get the library to a state where it supports GPU acceleration and N-dimensional tensors in order to be able to get crazy with different models that can be implemented. The objective is to get it as feature-complete as possible
